DropboxPortableAHK.exe 1.6.8.4 beta
by Nicolas Schneider


Description:
I tried many of the portable dropbox version out there, but none of them has made me happy.
So I started to create my own DropboxPortableAHK, here it is.

Instructions:
1. start DropboxPortableAHK.exe
2. set up your configuration during the setup routine
3. at the end of the configuration you need to setup your Dropbox account
3.1. Do not put your Dropbox folder to you external drive in the Dropbox setup. Instead, put it anywhere on your local drive, DropboxPortableAHK will move it to the location you specified in the configuration after the setup has completed.
4. Happy syncin'!

From now on, simply start DropboxPortableAHK.exe and you are done.
Even if you move from Vista/7 to XP (usb-stick) dropbox does not have to be set up again.


Problems:
My context menu on my Dropbox items does not work anymore:
This feature was removed, otherwise Dropbox would create files outside the portable folder, which is not acceptable.


Tips:
-To show the settings again hold down your 'Shift' key while starting DropboxPortableAHK.
-To start SyncAndGo mode manually hold down your 'Ctrl' key while starting DropboxPortableAHK.
