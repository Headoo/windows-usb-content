We are also liable for damages to commercial users in cases of simple negligence resulting in injury to life, body or health, or resulting in a breach of an essential contractual obligation. In that case, however, liability shall be limited to replacement of the foreseeable, typical damage. In no event are we liable for any special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages whatsoever. The above limitations of liability do not apply if we maliciously concealed a defect or assumed liability for the condition of the goods. The same will not apply to your claims under the German Product Liability Act, if this EULA is subject to German law pursuant to section 14.
